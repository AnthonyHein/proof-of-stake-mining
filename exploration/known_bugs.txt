- If the exploration depth is x. Then for states with sequence length x, the explorer will not
bound this state with any ActionBound. It will only use LemmaLowerBound or LemmaUpperBound. This
is because taking an action and looking at subsequent states would exceed the exploration depth.

- Running with exploration depth 9 does not terminate.

- Cannot use "promised" actions (like selfish mining) as lower bounds.
